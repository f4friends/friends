This repo has two branches
* master -> has the code that can be deployed as a google cloud function to access a google sheet
* gh-pages -> has the code for page hosted on https://prep4demos.github.io/demo/

This was prepared as part of the demo used during the IWD talk on April 6th 2019, as part of the demo we used the following tools besides Github and GCP
1. https://www.draw.io    for diagramming all the systems involved
2. https://jsfiddle.net   for designing the page - getting started and editting the html,js and css
3. Zenhub plugin used with Github to get the kanban board
